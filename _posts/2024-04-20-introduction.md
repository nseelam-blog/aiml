# Day 1: Start of the blog

I'm launching a blog that discusses various deep-dives of methods, architectures, or papers I find interesting. The goal of this blog will be to create tutorials to help people (and myself) dissect interesting topics. Code is intuitive, and seeing practical examples can be useful to test both how much we understand something, but also how to improve and extend upon it.
